# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built using Pygame, featuring adjustable difficulty, dynamic gameplay. As the snake grows longer, the speed of the game increases to enhance the challenge.

## Features
- **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Move the snake to collect food and grow in size.
- **Adjustable Difficulty:** The speed of the game increases as the snake gets longer.
- **Game Over Conditions:** The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
### To install Pygame, run:

pip install pygame

## How to Play
- Use the **arrow keys** or **W**, **A**, **S**, **D** to control the snake's movement:
  - **Up**: Move the snake upwards.
  - **Down**: Move the snake downwards.
  - **Left**: Move the snake left.
  - **Right**: Move the snake right.
  
- The goal of the game is to **collect the white food items** that appear randomly on the screen.
- Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and your **score increases**.
- **Avoid colliding** with the snake's body or the walls, as this will cause the game to end.
- The gameâ€™s difficulty increases as the snake gets longer, making it faster and more challenging.

### Game Over:

  - The snake collides with itself.
  - The snake hits the boundary of the screen.
  
- When the game is over, a "Game Over" message will appear, and your final score will be displayed.
